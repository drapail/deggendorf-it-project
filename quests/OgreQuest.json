As you cautiously make your way through the undergrowth, you stumble upon a small clearing. To your surprise, an enormous Ogre stands before you, its eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and hostility. How do you proceed?",
  "FIGHT": "You bravely draw your weapon and charge at the Ogre. The battle is fierce, but your determination pays off. After a long struggle, you defeat the mighty Ogre, earning the respect of other adventurers and a legendary sword as a reward.",
  "HIDE": "You quickly assess the situation and decide to hide behind a large rock, hoping the Ogre won't notice you. Your heart pounds in your chest as the Ogre passes by, unaware of your presence. With a sigh of relief, you continue your journey, avoiding a potentially deadly encounter.",
  "NEGOTIATE": "With a calm demeanor, you attempt to reason with the Ogre, appealing to its sense of compassion. Surprisingly, the Ogre's aggressive stance softens, and it agrees to spare your life in exchange for a rare artifact hidden in a nearby dungeon. You cautiously accept the offer and set off on a new quest.",
  "ESCAPE": "Overwhelmed by fear, you turn and sprint away from the Ogre as fast as your legs can carry you. The Ogre roars in frustration and gives chase, but your agility allows you to narrowly escape its grasp.
